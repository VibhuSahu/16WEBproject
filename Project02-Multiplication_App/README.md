### Project Explanation:
#### HTML File (`index.html`):
- Sets up the structure of the webpage using HTML elements.
- Includes a form for users to input their answers to multiplication questions.
- Displays the current score and the multiplication question.
- Links to external CSS and JavaScript files for styling and functionality.

#### CSS File (`style.css`):
- Defines the styling for various HTML elements to create a visually appealing interface.
- Sets the background color, font styles, sizes, borders, and shadows to enhance the overall appearance of the webpage.
- Ensures responsive design by adjusting styles based on different viewport sizes.

#### JavaScript File (`script.js`):
- Retrieves elements from the HTML document using their IDs to interact with them dynamically.
- Generates random multiplication questions and displays them to the user.
- Stores the user's score in the browser's local storage to persist between page refreshes.
- Implements functionality to check the user's answer against the correct answer and update the score accordingly.
- Updates the displayed score in real-time based on the user's responses.

#### Image Directory (`img/`):
- Stores project-related images, such as icons or graphics, to be used in the webpage.

#### Overall Functionality:
- The project creates a simple multiplication quiz application.
- Users are presented with multiplication questions randomly generated between 1 to 10.
- They input their answers in the provided text field and submit them.
- The application checks the user's answer against the correct answer.
- If the answer is correct, the user's score increases by one; otherwise, it decreases by one.
- The updated score is displayed to the user, and it is stored locally in the browser for future visits.
- Users can continue answering questions and improving their score each time they visit the webpage.


### JavaScript Local Storage:

**Definition:** JavaScript local storage is a browser feature that allows websites to store data on a user's device.

**Purpose:** It enables websites to save information locally so that it persists across browser sessions.

**Usage:** Websites commonly use local storage for:
- Storing user preferences (e.g., theme settings, language preferences).
- Managing user authentication (e.g., storing authentication tokens).
- Saving form data or user inputs.

**Scope:** Local storage provides a larger storage capacity compared to session storage, typically up to 5MB per origin.

**Considerations:**
- Avoid storing sensitive information like passwords.
- Provide users with options to manage or clear stored data.

**Example:** In a quiz application, local storage can be used to store the user's score, allowing them to resume the quiz later without losing progress.
